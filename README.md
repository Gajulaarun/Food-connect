The Food Connect project is a Salesforce-based initiative aimed at addressing food waste and food insecurity by connecting surplus food suppliers with individuals and families in need. By leveraging Salesforce's platform, the project streamlines the process of redistributing leftover food, ensuring efficient and transparent management of donations.

Key Features of the Food Connect Project:

Volunteer Coordination: The application manages volunteer information, including availability and assignments, to facilitate effective food distribution.

Task Management: It oversees tasks related to food collection and delivery, ensuring timely and organized operations.

Venue Tracking: The system keeps records of venues donating surplus food, maintaining essential details for coordination.

Drop-off Logistics: It manages drop-off points and schedules, optimizing routes and times for food deliveries.

Several developers have contributed to this initiative by creating repositories and documentation to assist others in implementing similar solutions. For instance, the GitHub repository by Shruthikaa-R provides resources and insights into the project's development.
